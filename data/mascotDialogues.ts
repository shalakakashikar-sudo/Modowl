    "Modals are the 'mood ring' of grammar. What mood are we in today?",
    "Take your time. Wisdom cannot be rushed... unlike a deadline.",
    "I was just pondering the difference between 'Can' and 'May'. Fascinating stuff.",
    "If you need a hint, I *might* be able to help. See what I did there?",
    "Grammar is not about rules, it is about clarity. And style!",
    "*Hums a tune* ...Oh! Pardon me. I was lost in thought.",
    "Remember: 'Must' is a command, 'Should' is advice. Choose wisely."

  tickle: [
    "Hoo-hoo! That tickles my auxiliary verbs!",
    "Stop! You 'must' stop! See? That is a strong obligation.",
    "Did you know? 'Ought to' is the only modal that brings a 'to' to the party.",
    "Hee-hee! 'Would' is just 'Will' with a top hat on. Very polite.",
    "Careful! If you tickle me, I *might* fly away. (Possibility!)",
    "Fun fact: You can 'can' a can, but you can't 'must' a must!",
    "Hoo! 'Shall' we get back to work? That was a suggestion, by the way.",
    "I am an owl of high 'probability'!",
    "Only use 'Could' if you want to sound gentle. It’s the softest modal.",

  correct: [
    "Splendid! That fits the context perfectly.",
    "Hoo-ray! You captured the nuance exactly.",
    "Precisely! Dr. Ought is proud of that logic.",
    "A wise choice! You are mastering the mood.",
    "Correct! That modal carries the right amount of strength.",
    "Indubitably correct! *Nods approvingly*",
    "Excellent! You have earned a feather in your cap.",
    "Spot on! Your grammar is taking flight."

  // When the user answers incorrectly (Gentle corrections)
  incorrect: [
    "Hmm... close, but that sounds a bit too rude for this situation.",
    "Not quite. That modal is too weak! We need more certainty.",
    "Oops! 'Must' is too bossy here. Try something softer, like 'Should'.",
    "Think about the 'Degree of Probability'. Are we sure, or just guessing?",
    "A common mistake! But 'Can' is for ability, not permission here.",
    "*Tilts head* That doesn't sound quite right to my ears. Try again.",
    "No worries! Even wise owls make typos. Let's rethink.",
    "That is grammatically okay, but it changes the meaning. Look at the context."

  // When the user is taking a long time (Thinking state)
  thinking: [
    "Hmm... let me consult the Archives of Grammar...",

    "Searching for the most polite option...",
    "Let me weigh the necessity against the possibility...",

    "You didn't just memorize modals... you *understood* them.",
    "Fly confidently, my student. Your grammar is strong.",
    "Dr. Ought approves! You may now consider yourself a Modal Master.",
    "Outstanding! The world is your oyster... or should I say, your nest?"
